tools required to use following & additional notes :
  skip_spotify_ad.sh : (Linux)
    tools : spotify, xdotool
    notes : I merely kill all instances of spotify then reopen it and resume.
            I recommend creating a keyboard shortcut for calling this file.
            you may want to tweek the sleep settings for the command to work 
            depending on how long spotify will take to open on your device.
             
  skip_spotify_ad.ps1 : (Windows)
   notes : you will need to replace the name of user of spotify, but I 
           believe the location is the default
